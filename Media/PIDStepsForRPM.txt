This is to FIND AND VIEW the speed of your wheel, not to control the PID
You'll control the PID after this step.

//make a variable to act as a time point (oldTime)

//compare that variable to the current time (use "millis()" )

//use an IF to see if the time has been more than x milliseconds (1000 is an easy number to start with)

//inside the IF, you want to DETACH the interupts, do a little math to find RPM   (photocount / time = rpm)

// lcd.print out the rpm's and any other data you need

//once you have rpm, you want to reset photocount to 0, and oldTime to the new time (again, use millis()  )

//re-attach the interupts

// end the if }
